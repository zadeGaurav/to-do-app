This is a React todo app that can take todos from the user and manage as the user wants. This app has the power to set complete, delete, edit the to-do item, edit the tasks as the user wants, go back by undo button, and do a redo. To make this button look good I used react icons and used module-level CSS that has its benefits such as it live in one place and only applying to the component that we want.
